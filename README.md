# Experiment Reproduction
Download additional supplemental material from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1URvtT1r0kJlxDSG6PGnaWhvVuTzhyysX?usp=drive_link  
Unzip and place the `audio` and `experiments` folders in the root directory.  
Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` as venv or with the python environment manager of your choosing.  
Run the scripts in the root directory to repeat our experiments, modify experiment parameters at the top of the files as you see fit.  

# Parameter Overview

## Population Parameters
**POPSIZE (µ)**: Number of individuals in the population  
**N_OFFSPRING (λ)**: Number of offspring per generation  
**ONSET_FRAC (φ)**: Fraction of best approximated onsets for individual fitness calculation  
**INITIAL_N_SAMPLES_P** = [0.1, 0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]: Probabilities for how many samples an individual uses per onset on initialisation.  
**MAX_STEPS**: Number of generations until termination  

## Mutation Parameters
**α** = 6: Used in calculation of number of mutations  
**β** = 3: Used in calculation of number of mutations  
**L_BOUND** = 1: Minimum number of mutations to an individual  
**U_BOUND** = 10: Maximum mumber of mutations to an individual  
The number of mutations applied to an individual is calculated as follows:
floor(G * α + β), where G is a Gaussian number with mean 0 and std=1. The result is clipped to the interval [L_BOUND, U_BOUND].  

**SAMPLE_NUMBER_INCREASE_P** = [1, 0.8, 0.4, 0.1, 0]: for 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 samples currently present in the individual, determines the probability of an increase of samples, if the mutate_n_samples mutation is chosen.   

**CHOOSE_MUTATION_P** = [0.4, 0.4, 0.2]: Probabilities of each mutation to be applied.
